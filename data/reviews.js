    review: `I'd like to thank you and your brilliant team for all your hard work to help tenants out!
    My property manager is Xander, he just has helped me to complete my very first lease renewal done smoothly, he answered all my questions patiently, showed his full understanding of my concerns and tried his best to help me, I really appreciate his hard work and patience! Not to mention he always replied to my requests of property maintenance promptly, and always tried his best to get jobs done very quickly. He is a real problem solver, I'm very grateful to have him as my property manager!`

    review: `Super Vish to the rescue! We had bought a unit in the city with Vish 8 years ago.  During the years he has kept in touch with us by updating on the current market.

    Vish is very personable, when it came to selling the same unit again we called upon his service.  We got a contract on the unit as soon as it came to the market with a 14 day settlement.  Through team work the deal settled on time (with a near missed hiccup).   For your real estate needs call Vish and his team.`

    review: `Xperience helped us get a great sale price. Rock-solid advice from Vish on how to promote and sell this property; and as a result, we got a much better sale price than expected. These guys are professional and very easy to work with. Vish's knowledge of the property market and his ability to establish trust and communicate effectively with both sides, myself and potential buyers, made all the difference.`

    review: `My partner and I have been renting our unit for a year through Xperience and have had nothing but amazing service from their team. Every query is answered promptly, maintenance requests are dealt with efficiently and professionally, they have a great personal touch to their customer service and we are very happy to have them on our side. Special mention goes to Jaz, our property manager. She's an absolute superstar. Thank you Xperience Team! :)`

    review: `It has been a very smooth and easy process to rent a CBD apartment from Jaz and the team and it's been a year and more since. I've had to get a few things fixed and the tradesmen they use are prompt and everything is sorted out quickly. I would recommend leasing from Xperience. Great so far.`
